#Study of the electric distribution network of a mountain village

----
For my class of "Distributed generation" during my studies at "Grenoble INP - ENSE3" we work on the analysis of the electric distribution network of a mountain village. Most of the analysis was developed in Python.

Info about the project:

The village is located deep in a mountain valley. Electrical distribution is operated by a municipal utility. The village includes the following electrical systems:
- A nearby ski resort with two chairlifts,
- Street light,
- A water tower,
- A small sawmill business,
- Communal site: Town Hall + multipurpose room + technical services,
- Private subscribers (residential and commercial)

The village center is served by an overhead line of 8 km in length and 20 kV rated voltage (conductor cross section is 150 mmÂ²). The short-circuit power available at the source substation 63/20 kV is 500 MVA. The power at the various points of the village is obtained from a main MV / LV substation situated near the village centre. The ski resort - located 5 km further - is supplied from the latter electric node at the village centre.
In order to develop the village, local authorities are considering the creation of an eco-district in a natural area at the edge of the village and the use of solar and hydraulic production opportunities.
